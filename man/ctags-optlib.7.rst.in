DESCRIPTION
-----------

**Exuberant-ctags**, the ancestor of **Universal-ctags**, has provided
the way to define a new parser from command line.  Universal-ctags
extends and refines this feature. **optlib parser** is the name for such
parser in Universal-ctags. "opt" intents a parser is defined with
combination of command line options. "lib" intents an optlib parser
can be more than ad-hoc personal configuration.

This man page is for people who wants to define an optlib parser. The
reader should read ctags(1) of Universal-ctags first. Following
options are for defining (or customizing) a parser:

* ``--langdef=``
* ``--kindedef-<LANG>=``
* ``--fielddef-<LANG>=``
* ``--extradef-<LANG>=``
* ``--map-<LANG>=``
* ``--regex-<LANG>=``

Following options are for controlling loading parser
definition:

* ``--optlib-dir=[+]directory``
* ``--options=file|directory``
* ``--options-maybe=pathname``

The design of options and notations for defining a parser in
Exuberant-ctags may focus on reducing the number of typing by user.
Reducing the number of typing is important for users who want to
define (or customize) a parser quickly.

On the other hand, the design in Universal-ctags focuses on
maintainability. The notation of Universal-ctags is redundant than
that of Exuberant-ctags; the newly introduced kind should be declared
explicitly, (long) names are approved than single letter flags
specifying kinds, and naming rules are stricter.


Storing a parser definition to a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Though it is possible to define a parser from command line, you don't
want to type the same command line each time when you need the parser.
You can store options for defining a parser into a file.

@CTAGS_NAME_EXECUTABLE@ loads files (preload files) listed in "FILES"
section of ctags(1) at program starting up. You can put your parser
definition needed usually to the files.

``--options=pathname``, ``--options-maybe=pathname``, and
``--optlib-dir=[+]directory`` are for loading optlib files you need
occasionally. See "COMMAND LINE INTERFACE" section of ctags(1) for
these options.

As explained in FILES section of ctags(1), options for defining a
parser listed line by line in an optlib file. Prefixed white spaces are
ignored. A line starting with '#' is treated as a comment.  Escaping
shell meta character is not needed.

Use ".ctags" as file extension for optlib file. You can define
multiple parsers in an optlib file but it is better to make a file for
each parser definition.

``--_echo=msg`` and ``--_force-quit=[num]`` options are for debugging
optlib parser.


Overview for defining a parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Design the parser

   You need know both the target language and the ctags'
   concepts (definition, reference, kind, role, field, extra). About
   the concepts, ctags(1) of Universal-ctags may help you.

2. Give a file pattern or file extension for activating the parser

   Use ``--map-<LANG>=[+|-]extension|pattern``.

3. Give a name to the parser

   Use ``--langdef=name`` option. *NAME* is referred as *<LANG>* in
   the later steps.

4. Define kinds

   Use ``--kinddef-<LANG>=letter,name,description`` option.
   Universal-ctags introduces this option.  Exuberant-ctags doesn't
   have. In Exuberant-ctags, a kind is defined as a side effect of
   specifying ``--regex-<LANG>=`` option. So user doesn't have a
   chance to recognize how important the definition of kind.

5. Define patterns

   Use ``--regex-<LANG>=/regexp/replacement/[kind-spec/][flags]`` option.

   As *KIND-SPEC*, you can use the letter defined with
   ``--kinddef-<LANG>=letter,name,description`` option.

EXAMPLE
------------

This is the definition (pod.ctags) used in ctags for parsing pod
(https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) file.

::

   --langdef=pod
   --map-pod=+.pod

   --kinddef-pod=c,chapter,chapters
   --kinddef-pod=s,section,sections
   --kinddef-pod=S,subsection,subsections
   --kinddef-pod=t,subsubsection,subsubsections

   --regex-pod=/^=head1[ \t]+(.+)/\1/c/
   --regex-pod=/^=head2[ \t]+(.+)/\1/s/
   --regex-pod=/^=head3[ \t]+(.+)/\1/S/
   --regex-pod=/^=head4[ \t]+(.+)/\1/t/


OPTION ITEMS
------------

``--extradef-<LANG>=...``
	TBW

``--fielddef-<LANG>=...``
	TBW

``--langdef=name``
	Defines a new user-defined language, *name*, to be parsed with regular
	expressions. Once defined, name may be used in other options taking
	language names.

``--list-regex-flags``
	Lists the flags that can be used in ``--regex-<LANG>`` option.

``--kinddef-<LANG>=letter,name,description``
    Define a kind for *<LANG>*.
	Be not confused this with ``--kinds-<LANG>``.

	*letter* must be an alphabetical character ('[0-9a-zA-EG-Z]')
	other than "F". "F" has been reserved for representing a file
	since Exuberant-ctags.

	*name* also must come from alphabetical characters ('[0-9a-zA-Z]+').
	Do not use "file" as *name*. It has been reserved for representing
	a file since Exuberant-ctags.

	*description* comes from any printable ASCII characters. The
	exception is "{" and "\". "{" is reserved for adding flags
	this option in the future. So put "\" before "{" to include
	"{" to a description. To include "\" itself to a description,
	put "\" before "\".

	Both *letter*, *name* and their combination must be unique in
	a *<LANG>*.

	This option is newly introduced in Universal-ctags.  This option
	reduces the typing defining a regex pattern with
	``--regex-<LANG>=``, and keeps the consistency of kind
	definitions in a language.

	The *letter* can be used as an argument for ``--kinds-<LANG>``
	option to enable or disable the kind. Unless ``K`` field is
	enabled, the *letter* is used as value in the "kind" extension
	field in tags output.

	The *name* surrounded by braces can be used as an argument for
	``--kind-<LANG>`` option. If ``K`` field is enabled, the *name*
	is used as value in the "kind" extension field in tags output.

	The *description* and *letter* are listed in ``--list-kinds``
	output. All three elements of kind-spec are listed in
	``--list-kinds-full`` output. Don't use braces in the
	*description*. They will be used meta characters in the future.

``--regex-<LANG>=/regexp/replacement/[kind-spec/][flags]``
	The /regexp/replacement/ pair defines a regular expression
	replacement pattern, similar in style to sed substitution
	commands, with which to generate tags from source files mapped to
	the named language, *<LANG>*, (case-insensitive; either a built-in
	or user-defined language). The regular expression, regexp, defines
	an extended regular expression (roughly that used by egrep(1)),
	which is used to locate a single source line containing a tag and
	may specify tab characters using \t. When a matching line is
	found, a tag will be generated for the name defined by
	replacement, which generally will contain the special
	back-references \1 through \9 to refer to matching sub-expression
	groups within regexp.  The '/' separator characters shown in the
	parameter to the option can actually be replaced by any
	character. Note that whichever separator character is used will
	have to be escaped with a backslash ('\') character wherever it is
	used in the parameter as something other than a separator. The
	regular expression defined by this option is added to the current
	list of regular expressions for the specified language unless the
	parameter is omitted, in which case the current list is cleared.

	Unless modified by flags, regexp is interpreted as a Posix
	extended regular expression. The replacement should expand for all
	matching lines to a non-empty string of characters, or a warning
	message will be reported. An optional kind specifier for tags
	matching regexp may follow replacement, which will determine what
	kind of tag is reported in the "kind" extension field (see
	ctags-tags(5)).

	kind-spec has two forms: letter only form and full form.  The
	letter form assumes using ``--regex-<LANG>`` option with
	``--kinddef-<LANG>`` option. The kind-spec in ``--regex-<LANG>``
	option just refers a letter defined with
	``--kinddef-<LANG>``. This form is recommended in Universal-ctags.

	The full form of kind-spec is in the form of a single *letter*, a
	comma, a *name* (only out of alphabetical characters), a comma, a
	*description*. See the description of
	``--kinddef-<LANG>=letter,name,description`` option about how the
	elements are used.

	Either the kind *name* and/or the *description* can be omitted.
	However, unless the *letter* is not defined with
	``--kinddef-<LANG>`` option, omitting is not recommended in in
	Universal-ctags. The omitting form is supported only for keeping
	the compatibility with Exuberant-ctags. Supporting the omitting
	form will be removed from Universal-ctags in the future.  If
	kind-spec is omitted, it defaults to "r,regex".

	About *flag*, see "Flags for ``--regex-<LANG>`` option".

``--_echo=msg``
	Print *msg* to the standard error stream.  This is helpful to
	understand (and debug) optlib loading feature of Universal-ctags.

``--_force-quit=[num]``
    Exits immediately when this option is processed.  If *num* is used
	as exit status. The default is 0.  This is helpful to debug optlib
	loading feature of Universal-ctags.


FLAGS FOR ``--regex-<LANG>`` OPTION
-----------------------------------

You can specify more than one flag at the end of ``--regex-<LANG>`` to
control how Universal-ctags uses the pattern.

Exuberant-ctags uses a *letter* to represent a flag. In
Universal-ctags, a *name* surrounded by braces (name form) can be used
in addition to *letter*. The name form makes a user reading an optlib
file easier. The most of all flags newly added in Universal-ctags
don't have the letter representation. All of them have only the name
representation. ``--list-regex-flags`` lists all the flags.

``basic`` (letter form ``b``)
	The pattern is interpreted as a Posix basic regular expression.

``exclusive`` (letter form ``x``)
	skip testing the other patterns if a line is matched to this
	pattern. This is useful to avoid using CPU to parse line comments.

``extend`` (letter form ``e``)
	The pattern is interpreted as a Posix extended regular
	expression (default).

``icase`` (letter form ``i``)
	The regular expression is to be applied in a case-insensitive
	manner.

``placeholder``
	TBW

``scope``
	TBW

GNU info documentation for regex (e.g. "info regex").
